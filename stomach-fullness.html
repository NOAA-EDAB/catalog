<p>An index of stomach fullness was calculated from NEFSC autumn bottom trawl food habits data, as a simple ratio of estimated stomach content weight to total weight of an individual fish. Stomach fullness may be a better measure than absolute stomach weight if combining across species into a feeding guild, to prevent larger animals with heavier stomachs from dominating the index. An average stomach fullness was calcuated annually for each species and Ecological Production Unit (EPU).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.2.1</span> Data Sources</h3>
<p>Stomach contents weights and individual fish weights (both to the nearest gram) were collected on the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys from 1992-present aboard RVs Albatross IV, Delaware II and the Henry B. Bigelow (see <a href="https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport">Food Habits Database (FHDBS)</a> for access procedures).</p>
