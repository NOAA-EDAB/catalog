## Introduction to Indicator
$R_t=j=p_{jt}y_{jt}$

## Key Results and Visualizations
testing images. Either option works. maybe straight markdown is cleaner since we get to see if the image appears in the issue

NOTE: the path to the images is not intuitive. You need to specify the path with the `raw` "folder" in the url

1. Using markdown: This works great.

![Alexandrium cyst map](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/raw/master/workshop/images/Alexandrium_distribution_2024.png){width=100%}

2. Using rmarkdown: you can specify output width relative to space available. the image isnt rendered in this issue. Note again the path to the image has `raw` in the url

```{r ,fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/raw/master/workshop/images/Alexandrium_distribution_2024.png")
```
