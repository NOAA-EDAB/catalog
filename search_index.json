The GOM is the southern limit of the viable reproduction in the range of this subarctic species, although it is often seasonally present in the MAB. Because of its thermal tolerance limitations as a subarctic species, it is projected that Calanus abundance will be drastically reduced in the GOM by the later half of this century if carbon emissions continue to increase as expected (@Grieve2017). The life cycle of C. finmarchicus is complex, undergoing six nauplii stages and five copepodite stages before reaching maturity as an adult and reproducing (@Marshall1972). This complex lifecycle involves molting between stages and typically also involves a resting stage termed diapause, where immature copepodite stage-5 individuals migrate into deep basins and become dormant at depth during the late fall into winter. As a population present in waters across the North Atlantic, diapause is typically the rule and reproduction results in one generation per year (@Head2000), however, flexibility in maturation rates in response to environmental conditions and food availability allows Calanus to bypass the diapause phase and can result in several generations of Calanus within a year, particularly on GB (@Durbin1997). These local dynamics add to the variability of Calanus abundance in the NES system. North Atlantic right whales (NARW) are a primary predator of Calanus finmarchicus. Due to a reduction in the filter feeding efficiency below ~ 1.5 mm (@Mayo2020), NARW primarily feed on adult and late stage copepodites (c4, c5). Typically only stage-5 copepodites undergo diapause and thus are often the bulk of prey available to NARW. In the GOM, diapusing Calanus c5 are typically found in the deep basins during late fall and winter. In the GOM during all seasons from 2000-2010, C. finmarchicus had high levels of abundance, coinciding with a period of strong recovery for the NARW population. That recovery plateaued after 2010 and has since been in decline. Adult C. finmarchicus levels reached time series maxima between 2000-2010 in the GOM, and the abundance of stage c5 copepodites also reached time series maxima in both spring and fall during this period. Following 2010, the abundance of Calanus plummeted in the GOM and a regime shift to lower biomass was detected for both GOM and GBK (Sorochan et al. 2019). NARW abandoned their traditional feeding grounds in the GOM and were increasingly present in Canadian waters in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during summer and fall beginning in 2010 and peaking in 2015 (@Simard2019). This shift in distribution may be related to food availability and the abundance of larger species of Calanus in the GSL. 2.1.1 Plotted data 2.1.2 Raw data 2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Data Sources 2.2.2 Data Extraction 2.2.3 Data Analysis Code used to analyze calanus stage data can be found at this link. 2.2.4 Data Processing Code for processing Calanus stage data can be found here.

Shifts in physical conditions changed the salinity dynamics throughout the Chesapeake Bay environment, impacting habitat conditions and biological responses for multiple species of interest, including eastern oysters, blue crab, striped bass, shad and herring, invasive blue catfish, and underwater seagrasses. Low salinity levels recorded by NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office’s Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) at Stingray Point showed below-average levels starting in summer 2018 and continuing through spring of 2019 (see below). The above graph represents the salinity trends throughout the year in 2018 and 2019, as well as the daily average, which is the average salinity of each day from 2008-2019. These data were gathered from a CBIBS buoy located at Stingray Point near Deltaville, VA, and were chosen to demonstrate the anomalous salinity observations of the last two years because this particular buoy has the longest-running, most reliable continuous dataset currently available. Salinity in 2018 was slightly above average in the first half of the year, but declined to below-average levels by late May. Salinity remained consistently below average through the summer of 2019. About 10 weeks of data are missing in summer 2019 due to a battery failure in the buoy. Salinity increases to near-average levels by the time the buoy is again fully operational in September. These data demonstrate the anomalous low-salinity conditions that the Chesapeake Bay experienced throughout 2018 and 2019, which had significant impacts on living resources in the Bay. 3.2.1 Poor Dissolved Oxygen for Fisheries High flows during the winter and spring of Water Year 2019 came during a critical time of year when the nutrients delivered to the Bay fuel algal blooms, which cause low dissolved oxygen in the summer. Dissolved oxygen levels less than 2.0 mg/l (or hypoxia) are harmful to oysters, crabs, and fish. The high flows, and associated nutrient loads, during WY 2019 contributed to low summer dissolved oxygen levels in the Bay that were the 3rd worst recorded in Maryland waters, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. High summer water temperatures combined with low dissolved oxygen decreases suitable habitat for species such as striped bass and increases recreational fishing mortality. 3.2.2 Impacts to Oysters Elevated freshwater flows into the Chesapeake during 2018 lowered salinities over an extended time period, impacting spatset, disease, mortality and growth of oysters. In Maryland, the Spatfall Intensity Index, a measure of recruitment success and potential increase in the population, was 15.0 spat/bu, well below the 34-year median value of 39.8. Spatset intensity declined 36% from the previous year, with more than twice as many 2018 index bars having decreased spatfall when compared with 2017. Despite locally devastating freshets at some upstream locations, the Maryland-wide Observed Mortality Index remained the same as the previous year. At 14%, the 2018 index was well below the 34-year mean of 22.5%, continuing a 15-year trend as a consequence of low to moderate disease pressure. However, the prolonged period of elevated streamflows and consequent drop in salinity had a severe impact on the upper Potomac bars and to a lesser extent the upper bay oysters. In the Potomac River above Cobb Island, observed mortalities ranged from 88% to 100%. On the Eastern Shore side of the upper bay, the highest observed mortalities ranged from 25% to 100% and the western shore of the upper bay, mortalities ranged from 35% to 53%. 3.2.2.1 Oyster Hatchery Declines Oyster restoration and aquaculture in the Maryland portions of the Chesapeake Bay rely on oyster spat reared at the Horn Point Oyster Hatchery. Low salinity conditions may have resulted in the reduced spat production observed between 2018 and 2019 with 1.28 billion and 197 million viable spat respectively (Stephanie Alexander, presentation 2020). 3.2.2.2 Spread of invasive species Blue catfish, an invasive species in the Chesapeake, has spread over the last two summers due to the lower salinity levels. Biologists and state fishery managers are concerned about the predation impacts this spread can have on native species such as blue crabs, shad, herring, menhaden, and white catfish. 3.2.3 Plotting 3.2.4 Raw Data The raw data is available in the ecodata package. 3.3 Methods 3.3.1 Data sources The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) is a network of observing platforms (buoys) that collect meteorological, oceanographic, and water-quality data and relay that information using wireless technology. The stations have been in place since 2007. The Sting Ray station was deployed in July of 2008 and has been monitoring conditions on and off since then. The data is recorded in situ and sent to a server over a cellular modem. The standard CBIBS instrument is a WETLabs WQM mounted in the buoy well approximately 0.5 meters below the surface. Seabird purchased WETLabs and are now the manufacturer of the instruments. The WQM instruments are calibrated and swapped out on a regular basis. Salinity is stored as a double with the units of PSU. 3.3.2 Data extraction Data is directly inserted into a database from the real time system over the cellular network. The general public can use this link to explore and pull that data from the CBIBS database. The process for data extraction for this indicator can be found here. 3.3.3 Data analysis The data is processed by a python script. This creates an array and runs the data through a qartod routine. The result is a set of flags. Only the good data is used in the plot below. 3.3.4 Data processing Code for processing salinity data can be found here.

The satellite data show that the Chesapeake Bay experienced a warmer-than-average winter and a cooler-than-average spring, relative to the previous decade. These anomalies were also observed in situ by the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS). Water temperatures returned to average during the summer. The warm winter may have affected key Chesapeake Bay fishery resources during a critical period. Results of the Maryland juvenile striped bass survey, conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), showed low recruitment success in 2020, about fivefold below the long-term average. This low recruitment event may have been caused by a mismatch in striped bass (Morone saxatilis) larval and prey abundance due to the warm winter conditions, resulting in reduced larval survival. Warm winters typically trigger an early plankton bloom, including key copepod prey, which dies out before striped bass larvae are present in the tributary (Millette et al. 2019). Conversely, warmer winter temperatures may have reduced overwintering mortality of Chesapeake Bay blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus). Calculations done by MDNR based on data from the annual Bay-wide winter dredge survey indicate that blue crabs experienced the lowest overwintering mortality ever calculated (2020 Chesapeake Bay Blue Crab Advisory Report). Previous studies have demonstrated the correlation between winter water temperature and blue crab survival in the Chesapeake Bay (Bauer &amp; Miller 2010, Hines et al. 2010, Rome et al. 2005). 4.1.2 Salinity Observations from the NOAA CBIBS buoys indicated higher-than-average salinity throughout 2020, particularly in the upper Chesapeake Bay (Gooses Reef), suggesting that the region experienced less precipitation than usual. This is corroborated by river discharge data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); winter freshwater flow rates in particular were lower than the previous decade’s average (USGS 01492500 Sallie Harris Creek, MD). Salinity and freshwater input often play important roles in the survival and recruitment success of key Chesapeake Bay species such as striped bass and oysters (Crassostrea virginica). In addition to winter water temperature, survival of early life stages of striped bass in the Chesapeake Bay is strongly correlated with freshwater flow (Martino &amp; Houde 2010, Millette et al. 2019, North &amp; Houde 2003); high-flow regimes push zooplankton prey downstream, where they get trapped in the estuarine turbidity maximum with striped bass larvae. In low-flow years, zooplankton prey are less likely to match up with striped bass larvae in space and time, reducing larval survival and recruitment success. The combined effects of warm winter temperatures and low flow in 2020 may be the primary cause of the low recruitment success observed by the MDNR juvenile striped bass survey. Conversely, increased salinity often results in high juvenile oyster abundance in the Chesapeake Bay (Kimmel et al. 2014). In Maryland, the 2020 MDNR fall oyster survey documented above-average spatsets along the Eastern Shore as expected given the high salinity; however, the Western Shore did not fare as well, suggesting that local environmental conditions are also important. 4.1.3 Dissolved Oxygen A dissolved oxygen model operated by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) and Anchor QEA (www.vims.edu/hypoxia) estimated that the overall severity and duration of hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay was lower and shorter in 2020 compared to most recent years. A smaller-than-average spring freshet, which resulted in above-average salinity in the Bay, also might have decreased surface runoff and nutrient concentrations. Reduced nutrient inputs and cool spring temperatures likely contributed to reduced hypoxia in 2020. Dissolved oxygen is a critical component of habitat for benthic organisms and finfishes in the Chesapeake Bay such as blue crabs and striped bass. A smaller volume and shorter duration of hypoxia in the Bay suggests better environmental conditions for these species and, as a result, they would likely experience reduced stress in the summer. 4.1.4 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Structured habitat such as submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a critical component of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, and abundance and distribution are often dictated by summer water temperature, salinity, and light availability (Moore et al. 2014, Rybicki &amp; Carter 2002). Chesapeake Bay SAV is monitored annually by VIMS using aerial imagery and ground surveys (https://www.vims.edu/research/units/programs/sav/). Although the data from the 2020 surveys have not yet been processed, anecdotal reports suggest that SAV was patchy, with some areas showing expansion and others showing retraction. As with oysters, local environmental conditions likely play a critical role in SAV abundance. 4.1.5 Plotting 4.1.6 Methods Methods can be found here.

The cold pool plays an essential role in the structuring of the MAB ecosystem. It is a reservoir of nutrients that feeds phytoplankton productivity, is essential fish spawning and nursery habitat, and affects fish distribution and behavior [@lentz_seasonal_2017]. The average temperature of the cold pool has been getting warmer over time [@miller_state-space_2016]). These changes can affect distribution and migration timing for species that depend on the cold pool habitat. The area of the MAB cold pool was near average in 2018 (Map below), the last complete year of the dataset. The size of the cold pool varies annually, with the smallest sizes associated with record-warm years (e.g. 2012). The cold pool temperature shows a similar variation as its extent, both of which are strongly impacted by each early spring setting in temperature on the shelf. 5.1.1 Plotted data The plot below was built using the code found here.

However, the commercial fishing engagement and reliance indices are not confidential so are available to the public. All calculated indices can be found here. 6.1 Impact Summary Example from Mid-Atlantic: Commercial fishery engagement measures the number of permits, dealers, and landings in a community, while reliance expresses these numbers based on the level of fishing activity relative to the total population of a community. Here we focus on the top ten most engaged, and top ten most reliant commercial fishing communities and their associated social vulnerability. Barnegat Light and Cape May, NJ, and Reedville, VA are highly engaged and reliant with medium-high to high social vulnerability. Recreational fishery engagement measures shore, private vessel, and for-hire fishing activity while reliance expresses these numbers based on fishing effort relative to the population of a community. Of the nine recreational communities that are most engaged and reliant, Avon, Ocracoke and Hatteras, NC and Barnegat Light and Cape May, NJ scored medium-high or above for social vulnerability. Both commercial and recreational fishing are important activities in Montauk, NY; Barnegat Light, Cape May, and Point Pleasant Beach, NJ; and Ocracoke and Rodanthe, NC, meaning some of these communities may be impacted simultaneously by commercial and recreational regulatory changes. Of these communities, three scored medium-high or above for social vulnerability. These plots provide a snapshot of the relationship between social vulnerability and the most highly engaged and most highly reliant commercial and recreational fishing communities in the Mid-Atlantic. These communities may be vulnerable to changes in fishing patterns due to regulations and/or climate change. When any of these communities are also experiencing social vulnerability, they may have lower ability to successfully respond to change. These indicators may also point to communities that are vulnerable to environmental justice issues. 6.1.1 Plotted data Code used to build the community engagement indicator plot below can be found here.

The model domain extends north to south from the U.S./Canadian border to the N.C./S.C. border. The model differentiates six types of bottom-tending fishing gears: trawl, scallop dredge, clam dredge, longline, gillnet, and trap. Data inputs and outputs to Fishing Effects are gridded at a 5 km by 5 km resolution. The model outputs are monthly estimates of percent seabed habitat disturbance for each of these six gear types, by grid cell, from 1996-2017. The fishing effort spatial distributions (standardized as area swept in square kilometers) used for these model runs were generated using NEFSC’s Fishing Footprints method (DePiper 2014, Benjamin et al. 2018) combined with gear width and length dimensions estimated from fishing observer data. In addition, model runs based on a uniform fishing effort distribution are used to estimate which locations have the highest intrinsic vulnerability to fishing impacts. These intrinsic vulnerability outputs are useful for estimating the potential for habitat impacts to occur in areas where certain types of fishing effort are prohibited by regulation. Additional information about the model can be found in NEFMC (2020) and in the report for the precursor to Fishing Effects, the Swept Area Seabed Impact (SASI) Model (NEFMC 2011). The SASI vulnerability assessment, which was applied to Fishing Effects with minor modifications, was published in Grabowski et al. 2014. Smeltz et al. (2019) details the North Pacific implementation of the model and provides additional background. Sediment data inputs and both types of model outputs are available via the Northeast Ocean Data Portal (https://www.northeastoceandata.org/data-explorer/, under Habitat). The data portal hosts selected outputs from the Northeast Fishing Effects Model which combines seafloor data (sediment type, energy regime) with fishing effort data to generate percent habitat disturbance estimates in space and time. 7.1.1 Plotted data Either from the contributor or from ecodata 7.1.2 Raw data If available. 7.2 Methods 7.2.1 Data Sources 7.2.2 Data Extraction 7.2.3 Data Analysis 7.2.4 Data Processing 7.3 References Benjamin, S., M.-Y.

Other key variables in the predictive models include currents, nutrients, temperature, and salinity dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales (Li et al. 2020). After strong bloom events in 2005 and 2009, the time series suggest lower overall cyst abundance through 2020. However, bloom events and shellfishery closures usually occur somewhere in any given year. Economic impacts to inshore shellfisheries (mussels, softshell clams, quahogs) can be substantial (Jin and Hoagland 2008). Impacts to offshore shellfisheries can occur as well, for example surf clam and ocean quahog on Georges Bank 1988-1990 (Anderson et al. 1997). 8.1.1 Plotted data Figure 8.1: Gulf of Maine Alexandrium Cyst abundance.

Original data were collected by the State of Maine, Department of Marine Resources, which samples and tests blue mussels (Mytilis edulis) in coastal shellfish areas for HAB biotoxins on a weekly basis from March through October. Maine Department of Marine Resources – Biotoxins in Maine Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries – Shellfish classification areas New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services 9.2.2 Data Analysis Blue mussels (Mytilis edulis) were sampled at designated sites each year from March through October, and tissues were analyzed for presence and quantity of PSP toxins. Saxitoxin (STX) is a well-known PSP toxin, but a bloom can generate a range of related PSP toxins. Therefore, in many monitoring programs, toxins are reported as ““ug STX equivalents per 100 grams of shellfish tissue”, where the quantity of each toxin present is normalized by it’s toxicity compared to STX (Chung 2010). Data include total number of samples at multiple locations collected in each calendar year (2005-2019), numbers of samples above and below the PSP threshold of 44 ug/100g, and percentage of samples above the threshold. Simple bar and line graphs are used to plot the values for each variable as time series, 2005-2019.

They are driven by both atmospheric and oceanographic factors and can have dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems. Marine heatwaves are measured in terms of intensity (water temperature) and duration (the cumulative number of degree days) using satellite measurements of daily sea surface temperature. Plotted below are maximum intensity and cumulative intensity, which is intensity times duration. Here we define a marine heatwave as a warming event that lasts for five or more days with sea surface temperatures above the 90th percentile of the historical daily climatology (1982-2011). 10.1.1 Georges Bank In 2020, Georges Bank experienced six distinct marine heatwaves in the spring, summer, and fall, which included the warmest event on record. The strongest event began on July 8 and lasting 51 days. Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 1st on record in terms of maximum intensity (+4.33 °C above average on Aug 14) and 4th on record in terms of cumulative intensity (138 oC-days). Another relatively strong marine heatwave began on October 20 and also lasted 51 days with a peak warming on October 30 (+3.17 °C above average). This event was the 8th strongest on record in terms of cumulative intensity (111 oC-days). The strongest three marine heatwaves on record in Georges Bank occurred over the last five years (2015, 2016, 2020). Figure 10.1: Cumulative and maximum marine heatwave in Georges Bank Figure 10.2: Georges Bank Marine Heatwave events in 2020. 10.1.2 Gulf of Maine In 2020, the Gulf of Maine experienced five distinct marine heatwaves throughout all seasons with the strongest event beginning on June 17 and lasting 71 days. Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 7th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+4.02 °C above average on August 2) and 5th on record in terms of cumulative intensity (206 °C-days ) . Figure 10.3: Cumulative and maximum marine heatwave in the Gulf of Maine Figure 10.4: Gulf of Maine Marine Heatwave events in 2020. 10.1.3 Mid-Atlantic Bight In 2020, the Middle Atlantic Bight experienced eight distinct marine heatwaves with the strongest event beginning on July 18 and lasting 18 days. Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 30th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+2.61 °C above average on July 28) and 26th on record in terms of cumulative intensity (40 °C-days ). The region was not as warm as in recent years but is still experiencing more frequent marine heatwaves over the last decade, including this year, compared to the historical period from 1980’s to early 2000’s. Figure 10.5: Cumulative and maximum marine heatwave in the Mid-Atlantic Figure 10.6: Mid-Atlantic Marine Heatwave events in 2020. 10.1.4 Raw Data The raw data is available in the ecodata package. 10.2 Methods Marine heatwave analysis for Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine, and the Middle Atlantic Bight according to the definition in @hobday2016. 10.2.1 Data sources NOAA high-res OISST (daily, 25-km, 1982-2019) https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/db_search/DBListFiles.pl?did=132&amp;tid=79458&amp;vid=2423 10.2.2 Data extraction Each yearly file (global) was downloaded, concatenated into a single netcdf file using nco (Unix), and then cropped to the USNES region using Ferret. Each EPU’s time-series of SST was averaged using .shp file boundaries for the MAB, GB, and GOM (also done in Ferret) and saved to the three .csv files. 10.2.3 Data analysis The marine heatwave metrics Maximum Intensity [deg. C] and Cumulative Intensity [deg. C x days] are calculated using NOAA OISST daily sea surface temperature data (25-km resolution) from January 1982 to December 2019. The heatwaves are calculated based on the algorithms in Hobday et al. 2016 and by using a climatology of 1982-2011. These metrics were run R using https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/ 10.2.4 Data processing Marine Heatwave data were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using this R code.

These results show summertime pH around 7.8 in the depth regions in which Atlantic Surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and Atlantic Sea Scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) are found. Atlantic surfclam exposure to ocean acidification research in the laboratory for larvae and juvenile found that increased acidification resulted in changes in growth rates. Juvenile surfclams have a complex response to OA by adopting two different metabolic strategies as a function of CO2 concentrations (Pousse et al. 2020). It appears that surfclams have a metabolic depression in a pH range of 7.46-7.28 making them more sensitive than estuarine species to OA. There is a decrease in clearance rates (movement of water) , the amount of organic matter ingested decreases, and the assimilation rate with increased OA. Once the food is ingested there is no change in how they process the food (assimilation efficiency), but their ability to select and clear food does change under OA. In addition to changes in how they filter, there was a difference in shell weight. Increased OA resulted in lighter shells. Larval appear to also be sensitive to OA (Meseck et al., in press). Results of larvae suggest that levels above 800 ppm results in decreased growth. For both larvae and juveniles there was no difference in survival. It is unclear at this time what the effects on reproduction and recruitment would be. Currently dynamic energy budget models are being constructed using Pousse et al. (2020) data to predict how surfclams will respond to OA by the year 2100. It is noted that a project by PI Poach and Hennan was recently funded to do field analysis of Atlantic surfclam (both subspecies) trying to link OA and growth in the field. 13.1.1 Plotting Code for plotting can be found here. 13.1.2 Methods See @wright2020 for glider study and @pousse2020 for lab study.
