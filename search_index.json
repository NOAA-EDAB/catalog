In Maryland, shellfish aquaculturists are required to report their monthly harvests to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD-DNR). The MD-DNR then aggregates the harvest data for release in the Maryland Aquaculture Coordinating Council Annual Report [@ACC2017], from which data were collected. Similar to Virginia, New Jersey releases annual reports synthesizing electronic survey results from lease-holding shellfish growers. Data from New Jersey reflects cage reared oysters grown from hatchery seed [@Calvo2017]. 1.2.2 Data extraction Data were collected directly from state aquaculture reports.

Shifts in physical conditions changed the salinity dynamics throughout the Chesapeake Bay environment, impacting habitat conditions and biological responses for multiple species of interest, including eastern oysters, blue crab, striped bass, shad and herring, invasive blue catfish, and underwater seagrasses. Low salinity levels recorded by NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office’s Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) at Stingray Point showed below-average levels starting in summer 2018 and continuing through spring of 2019 (see below). The above graph represents the salinity trends throughout the year in 2018 and 2019, as well as the daily average, which is the average salinity of each day from 2008-2019. These data were gathered from a CBIBS buoy located at Stingray Point near Deltaville, VA, and were chosen to demonstrate the anomalous salinity observations of the last two years because this particular buoy has the longest-running, most reliable continuous dataset currently available. Salinity in 2018 was slightly above average in the first half of the year, but declined to below-average levels by late May. Salinity remained consistently below average through the summer of 2019. About 10 weeks of data are missing in summer 2019 due to a battery failure in the buoy. Salinity increases to near-average levels by the time the buoy is again fully operational in September. These data demonstrate the anomalous low-salinity conditions that the Chesapeake Bay experienced throughout 2018 and 2019, which had significant impacts on living resources in the Bay. 2.2.1 Poor Dissolved Oxygen for Fisheries High flows during the winter and spring of Water Year 2019 came during a critical time of year when the nutrients delivered to the Bay fuel algal blooms, which cause low dissolved oxygen in the summer. Dissolved oxygen levels less than 2.0 mg/l (or hypoxia) are harmful to oysters, crabs, and fish. The high flows, and associated nutrient loads, during WY 2019 contributed to low summer dissolved oxygen levels in the Bay that were the 3rd worst recorded in Maryland waters, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. High summer water temperatures combined with low dissolved oxygen decreases suitable habitat for species such as striped bass and increases recreational fishing mortality. 2.2.2 Impacts to Oysters Elevated freshwater flows into the Chesapeake during 2018 lowered salinities over an extended time period, impacting spatset, disease, mortality and growth of oysters. In Maryland, the Spatfall Intensity Index, a measure of recruitment success and potential increase in the population, was 15.0 spat/bu, well below the 34-year median value of 39.8. Spatset intensity declined 36% from the previous year, with more than twice as many 2018 index bars having decreased spatfall when compared with 2017. Despite locally devastating freshets at some upstream locations, the Maryland-wide Observed Mortality Index remained the same as the previous year. At 14%, the 2018 index was well below the 34-year mean of 22.5%, continuing a 15-year trend as a consequence of low to moderate disease pressure. However, the prolonged period of elevated streamflows and consequent drop in salinity had a severe impact on the upper Potomac bars and to a lesser extent the upper bay oysters. In the Potomac River above Cobb Island, observed mortalities ranged from 88% to 100%. On the Eastern Shore side of the upper bay, the highest observed mortalities ranged from 25% to 100% and the western shore of the upper bay, mortalities ranged from 35% to 53%. 2.2.2.1 Oyster Hatchery Declines Oyster restoration and aquaculture in the Maryland portions of the Chesapeake Bay rely on oyster spat reared at the Horn Point Oyster Hatchery. Low salinity conditions may have resulted in the reduced spat production observed between 2018 and 2019 with 1.28 billion and 197 million viable spat respectively (Stephanie Alexander, presentation 2020). 2.2.2.2 Spread of invasive species Blue catfish, an invasive species in the Chesapeake, has spread over the last two summers due to the lower salinity levels. Biologists and state fishery managers are concerned about the predation impacts this spread can have on native species such as blue crabs, shad, herring, menhaden, and white catfish. 2.2.3 Plotting 2.2.4 Raw Data The raw data is available in the ecodata package. 2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Data sources The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) is a network of observing platforms (buoys) that collect meteorological, oceanographic, and water-quality data and relay that information using wireless technology. The stations have been in place since 2007. The Sting Ray station was deployed in July of 2008 and has been monitoring conditions on and off since then. The data is recorded in situ and sent to a server over a cellular modem. The standard CBIBS instrument is a WETLabs WQM mounted in the buoy well approximately 0.5 meters below the surface. Seabird purchased WETLabs and are now the manufacturer of the instruments. The WQM instruments are calibrated and swapped out on a regular basis. Salinity is stored as a double with the units of PSU. 2.3.2 Data extraction Data is directly inserted into a database from the real time system over the cellular network. The general public can use this link to explore and pull that data from the CBIBS database. The process for data extraction for this indicator can be found here. 2.3.3 Data analysis The data is processed by a python script. This creates an array and runs the data through a qartod routine. The result is a set of flags. Only the good data is used in the plot below. 2.3.4 Data processing Code for processing salinity data can be found here.

These heatwaves are measured in terms of magnitude and duration by using satellite measurements of daily sea surface temperature. Here we use the marine heatwave metrics defined by Hobday et al. 2016 such that a warm event in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank is considered a marine heatwave if the event lasts for five or more days with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a historical climatology (1982-2010). In 2019, the Gulf of Maine experienced four distinct marine heatwaves in the summer and fall with the strongest event beginning on July 3 and lasting 53 days (GOM_2019_Heatwave_time_series.pdf dark red = strongest event of the year, light red = weaker events). Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 12th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+3.27 oC above average on Aug 1) and 12th on record in terms of cumulative intensity (112 oC-days [sum of daily intensity anomalies]) (GOM_1982_2019_Heatwave_Max_Intensity_time_series.pdf and GOM_1982_2019_Heatwave_Cumul_Intensity_time_series.pdf). The strongest heatwaves on record in the Gulf of Maine occurred in the summer of 2010 in terms of maximum intensity (+4.83 oC above average) and in the summer of 2012 in terms of cumulative intensity (630 oC-days). The impacts of the 2012 marine heatwave in the Gulf of Maine have been well documented within the lobster fishery (Mills et al. 2013). In 2019, Georges Bank experienced three distinct marine heatwaves in the summer and fall with the strongest event beginning on August 17 and lasting 20 days (GB_2019_Heatwave_time_series.pdf dark red = strongest event of the year, light red = weaker events). Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 15th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+3.14 oC above average on Aug 23) (GB_1982_2019_Heatwave_Max_Intensity_time_series.pdf). The strongest heatwaves on record in the Georges Bank occurred in the summer of 2016 in terms of maximum intensity (+4.06 oC above average) and in the winter/spring/summer of 2012 in terms of cumulative intensity (485 oC-days). 5.1.2 Marine Heatwaves (2019 MAB) Marine heatwaves can derive from both atmospheric and oceanographic factors that can have dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems.

These results show summertime pH around 7.8 in the depth regions in which Atlantic Surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and Atlantic Sea Scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) are found. Atlantic surfclam exposure to ocean acidification research in the laboratory for larvae and juvenile found that increased acidification resulted in changes in growth rates. Juvenile surfclams have a complex response to OA by adopting two different metabolic strategies as a function of CO2 concentrations (Pousse et al. 2020). It appears that surfclams have a metabolic depression in a pH range of 7.46-7.28 making them more sensitive than estuarine species to OA. There is a decrease in clearance rates (movement of water) , the amount of organic matter ingested decreases, and the assimilation rate with increased OA. Once the food is ingested there is no change in how they process the food (assimilation efficiency), but their ability to select and clear food does change under OA. In addition to changes in how they filter, there was a difference in shell weight. Increased OA resulted in lighter shells. Larval appear to also be sensitive to OA (Meseck et al., in press). Results of larvae suggest that levels above 800 ppm results in decreased growth. For both larvae and juveniles there was no difference in survival. It is unclear at this time what the effects on reproduction and recruitment would be. Currently dynamic energy budget models are being constructed using Pousse et al. (2020) data to predict how surfclams will respond to OA by the year 2100. It is noted that a project by PI Poach and Hennan was recently funded to do field analysis of Atlantic surfclam (both subspecies) trying to link OA and growth in the field. 7.1.1 Plotting Code for plotting can be found here. 7.1.2 Methods See @wright2020 for glider study and @pousse2020 for lab study.

This is accomplished by binning all samples for a given species to bi-monthly collection dates based on median cruise date and taking the mean, then fitting a spline interpolation between mean bi-monthly abundance to give expected abundance on any given day of the year. Code used for zooplankton data analysis can be found here. Copepod Abundance anomalies (Figure 9.1) are computed from the expected abundance on the day of sample collection. Abundance anomaly time series are constructed for Centropages typicus, Pseudocalanus spp., Calanus finmarchicus, and total zooplankton biovolume. The small-large copepod size index is computed by averaging the individual abundance anomalies of Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages hamatus, Centropages typicus, and Temora longicornis, and subtracting the abundance anomaly of Calanus finmarchicus. This index tracks the overall dominance of the small bodied copepods relative to the largest copepod in the Northeast U.S. region, Calanus finmarchicus. Euphausiids and Cnidarians Stratified abundance of euphausiids and cnidarians were included in the 2020 State of the Ecosystem reports (Figure 9.2).
