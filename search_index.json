To achieve consistent assessment over time and between jurisdictions, a multimetric indicator was proposed by the CBP partnership to provide a means for tracking the progress in all 92 management segments of Chesapeake Bay (Hernandez-Cordero et al., 2020; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). This indicator has been computed for each three-year assessment period since 1985-1987, providing an integrated measure of Chesapeake Bay’s water quality condition over the last three decades. The multimetric indicator required monitoring data on dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentrations, water clarity, SAV acreage, water temperature, and salinity. SAV acreage has been measured by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in collaboration with the CBP, which is available via http://web.vims.edu/bio/sav/StateSegmentAreaTable.htm. Data for all other parameters were obtained from the CBP Water Quality Database (http://www.chesapeakebay.net/data/downloads/cbp_water_quality_database_1984_present). These data have been routinely reported to the CBP by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Old Dominion University, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and citizen/volunteer monitoring initiatives. Monitoring data of DO, chlorophyll-a, and water clarity/SAV were processed and compared with water quality criteria thresholds according to different designated uses (DUs). These DUs are migratory spawning and nursery (MSN), open water (OW), deep water (DW), deep channel (DC), and shallow water (SW), which reflect the seasonal nature of water column structure and the life history needs of living resources. Station-level DO and chlorophyll-a data were spatially interpolated in three dimensions. Salinity and water temperature data were used to compute the vertical density structure of the water column, which was translated into layers of different DUs. Criteria attainment was determined by comparing violation rates over a 3-year period to a reference cumulative frequency distribution that represents the extent of allowable violation. This approach was implemented using FORTRAN codes, which are provided as a zipped folder. For water clarity/SAV, the single best year in the 3-year assessment period was compared with the segment-specific acreage goal, the water clarity goal, or a combination of both. For more details, refer to the Methods section of Zhang et al. (2018). The multimetric indicator quantifies the fraction of segment-DU-criterion combinations that meet all applicable season-specific thresholds for each 3-year assessment period from 1985-1987 to 2019-2021. For each 3-year assessment period, all applicable segment-DU-criterion combinations were evaluated in a binomial fashion and scored 1 for “in attainment” and 0 for “nonattainment”. The classified status of each segment-DU-criterion combination was weighted via segments’ surface area and summed to obtain the multimetric index score. This weighting scheme was adopted for two reasons: (1) segments vary in size over four orders of magnitude, and (2) surface area of each segment does not change with time or DUs, unlike seasonally variable habitat volume or bottom water area (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2017).

Science of the Total Environment 2018; 637-638: 1617-1625. 1.2 Key Results and Visualizations The indicator provides an integrated measure of Chesapeake Bay’s water quality condition (Figure 1). In 2019-2021, 28.1% of all tidal water segment-DU-criterion combinations are estimated to have met or exceeded applicable water quality criteria thresholds. Overall, the indicator has a positive and statistically significant trend between 1985-1987 and 2019-2021, which shows that Chesapeake Bay is on a positive trajectory toward recovery. This pattern has been statistically linked to total nitrogen reduction, indicating responsiveness of attainment status to management actions implemented to reduce nutrients (Zhang et al., 2018). 1.2.1 MAB 1.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: Chesapeake Bay Temporal scale: 3-year assessment period between 1985-1987 and 2019-2021. Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 1.4 Implications Patterns of attainment of individual designated uses are variable (Figure 2). According to Mann-Kendall trend analysis extended from Zhang et al. (2018), dissolved oxygen criterion attainment (migratory fish spawning &amp; nursery) showed a statistically significant long-term decline. By contrast, dissolved oxygen criterion attainment (specifically deep water and deep channel) and water clarity/SAV criterion attainment showed statistically significant long-term improvements, which may be an indication of increasing resilience in the bay ecosystem since the Bay restoration began. 1.5 Get the data Point of contact: Qian Zhang, qzhang@chesapeakebay.net ecodata name: ecodata::ches_bay_wq Variable definitions Period: Assessment period Year 1: Starting year of the assessment period Year 2: Ending year of the assessment period Total: The overall attainment indicator MSN-DO: Estimated attainment of the dissolved oxygen criterion for the migratory spawning and nursery designated use OW-DO: Estimated attainment of the dissolved oxygen criterion for the open water designated use DW-DO: Estimated attainment of the dissolved oxygen criterion for the deep water designated use DC-DO: Estimated attainment of the dissolved oxygen criterion for the deep channel designated use OW-CHLA: Estimated attainment of the chlorophyll-a criterion SW-Clarity/SAV: Estimated attainment of the bay grasses / water clarity criterion for the shallow water designated use Indicator Category: Published Methods Extensive analysis, not yet published Syntheses of published information Database pull Database pull with analysis Other 1.6 Public Availability Source data are publicly available. 1.7 Accessibility and Contraints No response tech-doc link https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/ches_bay_wq.html 1.8 References "],["phytoplankton-chlorophyll-size-class-and-primary-production.html", "2 Phytoplankton chlorophyll, size class and primary production 2.1 Indroduction to Indicator 2.2 Key Results and Visualizations 2.3 Indicator statistics 2.4 Implications 2.5 Get the data 2.6 Public Availability 2.7 Accessibility and Contraints 2.8 References", " 2 Phytoplankton chlorophyll, size class and primary production Description: Satellite derived phytoplankton data including chlorophyll concentration, phytoplankton size class, and primary production for the Northeast Continental Shelf and ecological production units.

Numerous environmental and oceanographic factors interact to drive the abundance, composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of phytoplankton. Satellite derived measurements of chlorophyll, the dominant photosynthetic pigment in phytoplankton, are used to estimate phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton growth depends on the availability of carbon dioxide, sunlight and nutrients and their growth rates can be influenced by water temperature, water depth, wind, and grazing pressure. Primary productivity is a measure of the amount of carbon produced by phytoplankton. The seasonal cycle of phytoplankton size distribution are typically dominated by larger-celled microplankton during the winter-spring and fall bloom periods, while smaller-celled nanoplankton dominate during the warmer summer months.

Sampling methods are described in Anderson et al. 2005. In the annual survey cruises, samples are obtained with a Craib corer, and Alexandrium cysts are counted from the top 1- cm of sediment layer. Results are extrapolated to estimate overall cyst abundance in the eastern, western, and entire Gulf of Maine. 3.2 Key Results and Visualizations Visualizations of the data include an annual time series plot of estimated cyst abundance, and a time series of maps depicting the spatial and temporal variability in the Gulf of Maine. Results are plotted as estimated total numbers of cells (10 to the 16th power) in Eastern Gulf of Maine (east of Penobscot Bay), Western Gulf of Maine (west of Penobscot Bay), Bay of Fundy (2003-2013 only), and entire Gulf of Maine. 3.2.1 MidAtlantic 3.2.2 NewEngland 3.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: Results are reported for the entire Gulf of Maine, and also by sub-regions: Eastern Gulf of Maine (east of Penobscot Bay), Western Gulf of Maine (west of Penobscot Bay), and Bay of Fundy (2003-2013 only). Temporal scale: Results are aggregated annually, and reported for 2003 to 2021. Cyst sampling is done in the late fall. Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 3.4 Implications The annual fall surveys of Alexandrium cyst distribution and abundance in the Gulf of Maine provide data needed to predict bloom events in the following year. Other key variables in the predictive models include currents, nutrients, temperature, and salinity dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales (Anderson et al. 2005, Li et al. 2009 &amp; 2020, McGillicuddy et al. 2011). After strong cyst deposition events in 2005 and 2009, the time series suggest lower overall cyst abundance through 2021. However, bloom events and shellfishery closures usually occur somewhere in any given year. Economic impacts to inshore shellfisheries (mussels, softshell clams, quahogs) can be substantial (Jin and Hoagland 2008). Impacts to offshore shellfisheries can occur as well, for example surf clam and ocean quahog on Georges Bank 1988-1990 (Anderson et al. 1997). 3.5 Get the data Point of contact: Moe Nelson, david.moe.nelson@noaa.gov ecodata name: ecodata::habs Variable definitions Name: 1) Year; Definition: calendar year; Units: yyyy. 2) Name: Var; Definition: Gulf of Maine region (West, East, Bay of Fundy, All); Units: categories. 3) Name: Value; Definition: Estimated cyst abundance; Units: numbers of cells * 10 to the 16th power) Indicator Category: Published Methods Extensive analysis, not yet published Syntheses of published information Database pull Database pull with analysis Other 3.6 Public Availability Source data are NOT publicly available. 3.7 Accessibility and Contraints Data were provided by consultation with Yizhen Li.

Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Christoper J. Patrick, David J. Wilcox, Jennifer R. Whiting, Anna K. Kenne, Erica R. Smith Affiliations: VIMS 4.1 Indroduction to Indicator Underwater grass beds are critical to the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. They provide food and shelter to fish and wildlife, sequester carbon, add oxygen to the water, absorb nutrient pollution, reduce shoreline erosion and help suspended particles of sediment settle to the bottom. Because they are sensitive to pollution but quick to respond to improvements in water quality, underwater grass abundance is a good indicator of the Bay’s health. Before Europeans colonized the region, up to 600,000 acres of underwater grasses may have grown along the shorelines of the Bay and its tributaries. By the mid-1980s, nutrient and sediment pollution had weakened or eliminated many of these grass beds. While climate change, shoreline hardening and stressors that reduce water clarity will continue to impact our restoration success, many of these stressors can be managed with on-the-ground efforts to reduce pollution and research has shown that nutrient reductions made under the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (Bay TMDL) have played a critical role in the overall underwater grass recovery documented since the Bay-wide aerial survey began in 1984. 4.2 Key Results and Visualizations SAV increased in the Mesohaline and Polyhaline zones, where SAV continued to recover from recent declines in some areas. The Mesohaline zone showed a 28% increase from 2021 (2,768 hectares, 6,840 acres). The Polyhaline zone showed a 17% increase from 2021 (1,145 hectares, 2,828 acres). The Tidal Fresh zone stayed essentially the same with a small decrease (29 hectares, 73 acres) while the Oligohaline zone showed a 15% decrease (501 hectares, 1,239 acres). The increases in the Mesohaline and Polyhaline zone largely reflect recovery following the SAV crash in 2019. Those losses in 2019 were largely due to declines in widgeongrass which has expanded over the past decade due to increases in water quality but is sensitive to wet springs like the one experienced in 2019. The expansion in polyhaline zone is also attributable to a La Nina climate cycle which has resulted in cooler summers, benefiting eelgrass. The primary losses in the Oligohaline were concentrated in a small area, the Gunpowder River, the Middle River, and the adjacent mainstem. These declines may have been influenced by phytoplankton blooms observed in those segments in the spring and summer of 2022. 4.2.1 MAB 4.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: The data covers the tidal Chesapeake Bay region. Temporal scale: 1984-2022, annual Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 4.4 Implications Bay-wide: In 2022, 76,462 acres of SAV were mapped in the Chesapeake Bay. This is 41% of the Bay SAV goal. • Tidal Fresh Salinity Zone: 19,185 acres in 2022 achieving 93% of the area’s 20,602-acre goal. • Oligohaline Salinity Zone: 7,145 acres in 2022 achieving 69% of the area’s 10,334-acre goal. • Mesohaline Salinity Zone: 30,932 acres in 2022 achieving 26% of the area’s 120,306-acre goal. • Polyhaline Salinity Zone: 19,200 acres in 2022 achieving 57% of the area’s 33,647-acre goal. The outlook toward achieving the outcome goal is uncertain. Gains from 2021 to 2022 are positive, indicating an on-course trajectory, but these gains don’t yet offset the recent major declines observed in 2019. Additional years of positive trajectory will help clarify whether this recent gain in 2022 is the start of a new positive trend toward higher levels of SAV across the Bay. 4.5 Get the data Point of contact: Christoper J.

Affiliations: NEFSC 5.1 Indroduction to Indicator The Northeast US has a long, rich history of commercial fishing. Species of all different types are caught using a plethora of different fishing gear from North Carolina to Maine. This data set aggregates the value of those landings adjusted for inflation to the start of the report year. Revenue is calculated by total and managed by the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council and New England Fisheries Management Council. Revenue can be visualized by feeding guilds as well as by region. 5.2 Key Results and Visualizations Commercial revenue by managed species has generally been down. The exception is on Georges Bank were there is a cyclical nature to revenue arising from rotational scallop management.

Revenue is largely driven by landings and fisheries economics. There are many factors that can effect revenue. Revenue is used as a proxy for profit but only tells one side of the story. Ultimately there is a need to get a better sense of fisheries costs to adequately address commercial profits. 5.5 Get the data Point of contact: Andrew Beet (Andrew.Beet@NOAA.gov) ecodata name: ecodata::comdat Variable definitions Name: Revenue; Definition: Total revenue for a region; Units: US dollars.

Heavier and fatter fish at a given length have higher relative condition which is expected to improve growth, reproductive output, and survival. Le Cren’s (1951) relative condition (Kn) is used in this study: Kn = W/W’ Where W’ is the relative length-specific mean weight for the population in a given region. For this work, length-weight coefficients from Wigley et al. (2003) were used to calculate W’. Individual fish weights were total body weights from Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) fall bottom trawl surveys. Most finfish species included in this study are spring or summer spawners, so the fall survey was chosen to reduce variability of gonad weights in the spring survey as the fish ramp up for spawning.

NMFS-NE-171. 7.2 Key Results and Visualizations Condition factor for fish species in the MAB based on fall NEFSC bottom trawl survey data. MAB data are missing for 2017 due to survey delays, and no survey was conducted in 2020. A pattern of generally good condition was observed across many MAB species prior to 2000, followed by a period of generally poor condition from 2001-2010, with a mix of good and poor condition from 2011-2019. Condition was again mixed in 2022, but a number of species improved in condition from the relatively low condition year in 2021 (Fig. 43). Preliminary results of synthetic analyses show that changes in temperature, zooplankton, fishing pressure, and population size influence the condition of different fish species. 7.2.1 MAB 7.2.2 GB 7.2.3 GOM 7.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: The spatial scale for relative condition was on the EPU level.

Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Mark Wuenschel Affiliations: NEFSC 8.1 Indroduction to Indicator The energy density of prey indicates the the amount of energy passing from lower trophic levels to higher predators. Changes in ecosystem productivity and/or bioenergetic demands (e.g. metabolic increases due to rising temperature) can impact energy density. Energy density of fishes can vary widely (several fold), particularly for some species that undergo seasonal cycles in energy allocation to reproduction, energy allocation to migration, or seasonal/ontogenetic shifts in energy storage. The value of forage species to higher trophic levels is a function of the their energy density. 8.2 Key Results and Visualizations Variable plotted are the mean energy density (kJ/g) for eight species across seasons and years. The reference lines represent estimates from prior studies where available for comparison. The energy density of Atlantic Herring has been well below the available estimates from the 1980s and 1990s, but is showing some signs of improving. 8.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: Full shelf Temporal scale: Spring and Fall Bottom Trawl Survey Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 8.4 Implications No response 8.5 Get the data Point of contact: Mark Wuenschel (mark.wuenschel@noaa.gov) ecodata name: ecodata::energy_density Variable definitions Energy Density (kJ/g) for each species.

Affiliations: NEFSC 9.1 Indroduction to Indicator Diversity estimates have been developed to understand whether the overall structure of the ecosystem has remained stable or is changing. There are a large number of diversity indices that can be used to measure diversity; for the purposes of the State of the Ecosystem report we report on the expected number of species in a sample size (E(Sn)). These “rarefied” samples allow for comparisons between sample sites with varying number of species present. The estimate of (E(Sn) is less biased than other diversity indices which usually increase with sample size. It also has a more meaningful biological interpretation than other indices. For example, if a predator eats 10 random individuals, E(Sn) will predict the number of species consumed. 9.2 Key Results and Visualizations Due to the shift to the NOAA vessel Henry B. Bigelow in 2009 and the inability to correct for species composition, the time series is broken into Albatross and Bigelow stanzas. The only apparent trend in the data is from the Albatross time period in the Gulf of Maine. 9.2.1 MidAtlantic 9.2.2 NewEngland 9.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: By EPU Temporal scale: Spring (March-May) and Fall (September-November) Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 9.4 Implications Diversity is used as a proxy for stability. Changes in ecological diversity over time may indicate altered ecosystem structure with implications for fishery productivity and management. This indicator shows that the underlying ecosystem is relatively stable with the possibility that the Gulf of Maine is becoming more diverse. Increasing adult diversity in the Gulf of Maine suggests an increase in warm-water species and should be closely monitored. 9.5 Get the data Point of contact: Andrew Beet (Andrew.Beet@NOAA.gov) ecodata name: ecodata::exp_n Variable definitions Name: Season Region Expected Number of Species - Vessel; Definition: The expected number of species per 1000 randomly sampled individuals from a region for a given season on either the Albatross or Bigelow.

Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Daniel Linden; Richard Pace; New England Aquarium Affiliations: NEFSC 14.1 Indroduction to Indicator Endangered North Atlantic right whales are approaching extinction. The latest population estimate for the beginning of 2022 indicates there 356 individuals remaining. The species has been experiencing an Unusual Mortality Event since 2017, which is ongoing. Primary threats to the species—and primary drivers of the Unusual Mortality Event—are entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes. Climate change is also affecting every aspect of their survival. It is changing their ocean habitat, their migratory patterns, the location and availability of their prey, and even their risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear or struck by vessels. 14.2 Key Results and Visualizations The North Atlantic right whale population was on a recovery trajectory until 2010, but has since declined (Fig. x). The most recent estimate of total population size in 2022 was 356 whales, with a 95% credible interval ranging from 346 to 363. The population continues to be in decline since 2011, though the short-term trend is equivocal due to the recent increase in survival. Reduced survival rates of adult females and diverging abundance trends between sexes have also been observed. North Atlantic right whale calf counts have generally declined after 2009 to the point of having zero new calves observed in 2018 (Fig. x). However, since 2019, we have seen more calf births each year with 15 births in 2022 and 12 in 2023. This year, the Unusual Mortality Event (UME) for North Atlantic right whales continued. Since 2017, the total UME right whale mortalities includes 35 dead stranded whales, 14 in the US and 21 in Canada. When alive but seriously injured whales (22) and sublethal injuries or ill whales (37) are taken into account, 94 individual whales are included in the UME. Recent research suggests that many mortalities go unobserved and the true number of mortalities are about three times the count of the observed mortalities [3]. The primary cause of death is “human interaction” from entanglements or vessel strikes. 14.2.1 MidAtlantic 14.2.2 NewEngland 14.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: Full shelf and farther offshore corresponding to all EPUs and beyond Temporal scale: Annual 1990 - 2022 Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 14.4 Implications Strong evidence exists to suggest that interactions between right whales and both the fixed gear fisheries in the U.S. and Canada and vessel strikes in the U.S. are contributing substantially to the decline of the species [5]. Further, right whale distribution has changed since 2010. New research suggests that recent climate driven changes in ocean circulation have resulted in right whale distribution changes driven by increased warm water influx through the Northeast Channel, which has reduced the primary right whale prey (Calanus fnmarchicus) in the central and eastern portions of the Gulf of Maine [5–7]. Additional potential stressors include offshore wind development, which overlaps with important habitat areas used year-round by right whales, including mother and calf migration corridors and foraging habitat [8,9]. This area is also a primary right whale winter foraging habitat. Additional information can be found in the offshore wind section. The UMEs are under investigation and are likely the result of multiple drivers. For all large whale UMEs, human interaction appears to have contributed to increased mortalities, although investigations are not complete. 14.5 Get the data Point of contact: Daniel Linden (daniel.linden@noaa.gov), Danielle Cholewiak (danielle.cholewiak@noaa.gov), Debra Palka (debra.palka@noaa.gov) ecodata name: ecodata::narw Variable definitions “Palka_NARW_abundance_2023_10_02.csv 1) Year. lower95 = lower 95% confidence interval value in number of animals.

Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Stephanie Wood; Elizabeth Josephson Affiliations: NEFSC 15.1 Indroduction to Indicator Gray seals were extirpated from the northeast U.S. coast by the mid-20th century due to local and statewide bounty systems (Andrews and Mott 1967; Lelli et al. 2009). Since the late 1980s, ground and aerial surveys have documented the recovery and recolonization of pupping sites in northeast U.S. waters (Wood et al. 2022). This recovery is due in large part to the protection provided by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972. 15.2 Key Results and Visualizations The increase in bycatch of gray seals (Fig. x) since 1995 corresponds to an increase in numbers of gray seals in U.S. waters, which has risen dramatically in the last three decades. Based on a survey conducted in 2021, the size of the gray seal population in the U.S. during the breeding season was approximately 28,000 animals, while in Canada the population was estimated to be roughly 425,000. The population in Canada is increasing at roughly 4% per year, and contributing to rates of increase in the U.S., where the number of pupping sites has increased from one in 1988 to nine in 2019. Mean rates of increase in the number of pups born at various times since 1988 at four of the more data-rich pupping sites (Muskeget, Monomoy, Seal, and Green Islands) ranged from no change on Green Island to high rates of increase on the other three islands, with a maximum increase of 26.3% (95%CI: 21.6 - 31.4%; [4] Fig. x). 15.2.1 NE 15.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: Haul out sites off New England (Maine to New York) that correspond roughly to EPU’s Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB).

Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Geret DePiper, Min-Yang Lee Affiliations: NEFSC 23.1 Indroduction to Indicator Diversity estimates have been developed to understand whether specialization, or alternatively stovepiping, is occurring in fisheries of the Northeastern Large Marine Ecosystem. We use the average effective Shannon indices for species revenue at the permit level, for all permits landing any amount of NEFMC or MAFMC Fishery Management Plan (FMP) species within a year (including both Monkfish and Spiny Dogfish). We also use the effective Shannon index of fleet revenue diversity and count of active fleets to assess the extent to which the distribution of fishing changes across fleet segments. 23.2 Key Results and Visualizations Diversity estimates have been developed for species landed by commercial vessels with New England permits, and fleets landing managed species. Over the course of the last three years, there has been a steep decline in the effective number of species being landed in the commercial fleet, and current diversity is near a low since records began (Fig. 15). Commercial fishery fleet count has rebounded in recent years, although still at levels well below the historical average (Fig. 16). Here a fleet is defined as the combination of gear type (Scallop Dredge, Clam Dredge, Other Dredge, Gillnet, Hand Gear, Longline, Bottom Trawl, Midwater Trawl, Pot, or Purse Seine) and vessel length category (Less than 30 ft, 30 to 50 ft, 50 to 75 feet, 75 ft and above). Commercial fishery fleet count and fleet diversity have been stable over time in the MAB, with current values near the long-term average (Fig. 15). This indicates similar commercial fleet composition and species targeting opportunities over time. Commercial fisheries are relying on fewer species relative to the mid-90s, although current species revenue diversity has recovered somewhat in the last year (Fig. 16). 23.2.1 MidAtlantic 23.2.2 NewEngland 23.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: MA and NE Temporal scale: Annual Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 23.4 Implications Fleet diversity indices can be used to evaluate stability objectives as well as risks to fishery resilience and to maintaining equity in access to fishery resources [1]. In New England, the relatively low diversity estimates for the commercial fishery are likely driven by the continued reliance on a few species, sea scallops and lobster. This trend could diminish the capacity to respond to future fishing opportunities. In the Mid-Atlantic, stability in commercial fleet diversity metrics suggests stable capacity to respond to the current range of fishing opportunities. 23.5 Get the data Point of contact: Geret DePiper (geret.depiper@noaa.gov) ecodata name: ecodata::commercial_div Variable definitions Name: Permit revenue species diversity; Definition: Diversity of revenue across species averaged across permits; Units: effective Shannon.

Several indices are used to evaluate ecosystem overfishing, the Ryther index, the Fogarty index, and primary production required. Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Andrew Beet Affiliations: NEFSC 24.1 Indroduction to Indicator The Ryther index is defined as total catch per unit area in the ecosystem (JS Link and Watson 2019). The units are mt km^-2 year^-1. It measures the total removal of fish biomass by area in a Large Marine Ecosystem relative to how much that entire ecosystem can produce. In general terms, the lower the Ryther index, the less likely an ecosystem will be experiencing ecosystem overfishing. The Fogarty index is defined as ratio of total catches to total primary productivity in an ecosystem (JS Link and Watson 2019). The units are parts per thousand. A modification of the indices are used. Total landings are used in lieu of total catch. Accountng for total IUU (Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing) data, at the spatial footprint required, is not currently available. This will have the effect of reducing the value of the index (compared to using total catch, including IUU). 24.2 Key Results and Visualizations Compared to thresholds based on global estimates of primary production and catch, the Ryther index shows elevated levels of fishing in the Gulf of Maine and the Mid Atlantic but not at a point considered “extreme” (JS Link and Watson 2019).

Indicator family: Oceanographic Habitat Lower trophic levels Megafauna Social Economic Contributor(s): Geret DePiper, Scott Steinback Affiliations: NEFSC 25.1 Indroduction to Indicator We use total recreational harvest as an indicator of seafood production and total recreational trips and total recreational anglers as proxies for recreational value generated from the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions respectively. We estimate both recreational catch diversity in species managed by the Fisheries Management Councils; Mid-Atlantic (MAFMC), New England (NEFMC), South Atlantic (SAFMC) and Atlantic States (ASFMC), and fleet effort diversity using the effective Shannon index. 25.2 Key Results and Visualizations Total recreational harvest (retained fish presumed to be eaten) is down in the MAB. Although harvest has increased from a historic low in 2018, it is still below the long term average. Overall, recreational harvest (harvested fish presumed to be eaten) have also declined in New England. Recreational harvest in 2022 is up somewhat from the historical low seen in 2020. Recreational effort (angler trips) in New England increased during 1980-2010, but has since declined to just around the long-term average. Recreational fleets are defined as private vessels, shore-based fishing, or party-charter vessels. Recreational fleet diversity, or the relative importance of each fleet type, has remained relatively stable over the latter half of the time series in New England. In the Mid-Atlantic, recreational effort (angler trips) in 2022 is above the long-term average. However, recreational fleet diversity has declined over the long term. In New England, recreational species catch diversity has been above the time series average since 2008 with a long-term positive trend. In the Mid-Atlantic, recreational species catch diversity has no long term trend so is considered stable, and has been at or above the long term average in 8 of the last 10 years. 25.2.1 MidAtlantic 25.2.2 NewEngland 25.3 Indicator statistics Spatial scale: MA and NE Temporal scale: Annual Synthesis Theme: Multiple System Drivers Regime Shifts Ecosystem Reorganization 25.4 Implications The decline in recreational seafood harvest in New England stems from multiple drivers. Changes in demographics and preferences over recreational activities likely play a role in non-HMS (Highly Migratory Species) declines in recreational harvest, with current harvests near the lowest in the time series. Drivers of the the decline in Mid-Atlantic recreational seafood harvest are unclear. NOAA Fisheries’ Marine Recreational Information Program survey methodology was updated in 2018, so it is unclear whether the record-low landings for species other than sharks in 2018 are driven by changes in fishing behavior or the change in the survey methodology. Nevertheless, the recreational harvest seems to be stabilizing at a lower level than historical estimates. Diversity indices can be used to evaluate stability objectives as well as risks to fishery resilience and to maintaining equity in access to fishery resources. In New England, the absence of a long term trend in recreational angler trips and fleet effort diversity suggests relative stability in the overall number of recreational opportunities in the region. While the overall number of recreational opportunities in the MAB is above the long-term average, the continuing decline in recreational fleet effort diversity suggests a potentially reduced range of recreational fishing options. The downward effort diversity trend is driven by party/charter contraction (currently below 2% of trips), and a shift toward shore-based angling, which currently makes up 59% of angler trips. Effort in private boats remains stable at around 40% of trips. Changes in recreational fleet diversity can be considered when managers seek options to maintain recreational opportunities. Shore anglers will have access to different species than vessel-based anglers, and when the same species is accessible both from shore and from a vessel, shore anglers typically have access to smaller individuals. Many states have developed shore-based regulations where the minimum size is lower than in other areas and sectors to maintain opportunities in the shore angling sector. The increase in recreational species catch diversity in New England is due to recent increases in ASMFC and MAFMC managed species within the region as well as decreased limits on more traditional regional species. Stability in Mid-Atlantic recreational species catch diversity has been maintained by a different set of species over time. A recent increase in Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) managed species in recreational catch is helping to maintain diversity in the same range that MAFMC and New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) species supported in the 1990s. 25.5 Get the data Point of contact: Geret DePiper (geret.depiper@noaa.gov) ecodata name: ecodata::recdat Variable definitions Ex: 1) Name: piscivore_biomass; Definition: Biomass of piscivores; Units: kg tow^-1. 2) Name: forage_biomass; Definition: Biomass of forage fish; Units: kg tow^-1.

In the Mid Atlantic, stock status is above the minimum threshold for all but one stock, and aggregate biomass trends appear stable, so the decline in commercial seafood landings is most likely driven by market dynamics affecting the landings of surfclams and ocean quahogs, as landings have been below quotas for these species. The long term decline in total planktivore landings is largely driven by Atlantic menhaden fishery dynamics, including a consolidation of processors leading to reduced fishing capacity between the 1990s and mid-2000s. In New England, stock status and associated management constraints are likely contributing to decreased landings. With the poor or unknown stock status of many managed species, the decline in commercial seafood landings in the Gulf of Maine most likely reflects lower catch quotas implemented to rebuild overfished stocks, as well as market dynamics. 27.5 Get the data Point of contact: Sarah.Gaichas@noaa.gov ecodata name: ecodata::stock_status Variable definitions Variables in ecodata::stock_status Stock: Name of stock Last assessment: Most recent assessment year for stock status Council: “MAFMC” (Mid Atlantic Fishery Management Council), “NEFMC” (New England Fishery Management Council), or “Both” Code: Short stock name for plotting corresponding to Stock Var: “F.Fmsy” (Current year fishing mortality F relative to FMSY) “B.Bmsy” (Current year biomass B relative to BMSY) Value: Decimal value of Var Units: Unitless Indicator Category: Published Methods Extensive analysis, not yet published Syntheses of published information Database pull Database pull with analysis Other 27.6 Public Availability Source data are publicly available. 27.7 Accessibility and Contraints No response tech-doc link https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/stock_status.html 27.8 References "],["state-of-the-ecosystem-plain-language-glossary.html", "28 State of the Ecosystem Plain Language Glossary", " 28 State of the Ecosystem Plain Language Glossary Apex Predator: Predators with no natural predators of their own, such as large sharks, toothed whales, seals, tunas, and billfish.
