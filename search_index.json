Shifts in physical conditions changed the salinity dynamics throughout the Chesapeake Bay environment, impacting habitat conditions and biological responses for multiple species of interest, including eastern oysters, blue crab, striped bass, shad and herring, invasive blue catfish, and underwater seagrasses. Low salinity levels recorded by NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office’s Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) at Stingray Point showed below-average levels starting in summer 2018 and continuing through spring of 2019 (see below). The above graph represents the salinity trends throughout the year in 2018 and 2019, as well as the daily average, which is the average salinity of each day from 2008-2019. These data were gathered from a CBIBS buoy located at Stingray Point near Deltaville, VA, and were chosen to demonstrate the anomalous salinity observations of the last two years because this particular buoy has the longest-running, most reliable continuous dataset currently available. Salinity in 2018 was slightly above average in the first half of the year, but declined to below-average levels by late May. Salinity remained consistently below average through the summer of 2019. About 10 weeks of data are missing in summer 2019 due to a battery failure in the buoy. Salinity increases to near-average levels by the time the buoy is again fully operational in September. These data demonstrate the anomalous low-salinity conditions that the Chesapeake Bay experienced throughout 2018 and 2019, which had significant impacts on living resources in the Bay. 2.2.1 Poor Dissolved Oxygen for Fisheries High flows during the winter and spring of Water Year 2019 came during a critical time of year when the nutrients delivered to the Bay fuel algal blooms, which cause low dissolved oxygen in the summer. Dissolved oxygen levels less than 2.0 mg/l (or hypoxia) are harmful to oysters, crabs, and fish. The high flows, and associated nutrient loads, during WY 2019 contributed to low summer dissolved oxygen levels in the Bay that were the 3rd worst recorded in Maryland waters, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. High summer water temperatures combined with low dissolved oxygen decreases suitable habitat for species such as striped bass and increases recreational fishing mortality. 2.2.2 Impacts to Oysters Elevated freshwater flows into the Chesapeake during 2018 lowered salinities over an extended time period, impacting spatset, disease, mortality and growth of oysters. In Maryland, the Spatfall Intensity Index, a measure of recruitment success and potential increase in the population, was 15.0 spat/bu, well below the 34-year median value of 39.8. Spatset intensity declined 36% from the previous year, with more than twice as many 2018 index bars having decreased spatfall when compared with 2017. Despite locally devastating freshets at some upstream locations, the Maryland-wide Observed Mortality Index remained the same as the previous year. At 14%, the 2018 index was well below the 34-year mean of 22.5%, continuing a 15-year trend as a consequence of low to moderate disease pressure. However, the prolonged period of elevated streamflows and consequent drop in salinity had a severe impact on the upper Potomac bars and to a lesser extent the upper bay oysters. In the Potomac River above Cobb Island, observed mortalities ranged from 88% to 100%. On the Eastern Shore side of the upper bay, the highest observed mortalities ranged from 25% to 100% and the western shore of the upper bay, mortalities ranged from 35% to 53%. 2.2.2.1 Oyster Hatchery Declines Oyster restoration and aquaculture in the Maryland portions of the Chesapeake Bay rely on oyster spat reared at the Horn Point Oyster Hatchery. Low salinity conditions may have resulted in the reduced spat production observed between 2018 and 2019 with 1.28 billion and 197 million viable spat respectively (Stephanie Alexander, presentation 2020). 2.2.2.2 Spread of invasive species Blue catfish, an invasive species in the Chesapeake, has spread over the last two summers due to the lower salinity levels. Biologists and state fishery managers are concerned about the predation impacts this spread can have on native species such as blue crabs, shad, herring, menhaden, and white catfish. 2.2.3 Plotting 2.2.4 Raw Data The raw data is available in the ecodata package. 2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Data sources The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) is a network of observing platforms (buoys) that collect meteorological, oceanographic, and water-quality data and relay that information using wireless technology. The stations have been in place since 2007. The Sting Ray station was deployed in July of 2008 and has been monitoring conditions on and off since then. The data is recorded in situ and sent to a server over a cellular modem. The standard CBIBS instrument is a WETLabs WQM mounted in the buoy well approximately 0.5 meters below the surface. Seabird purchased WETLabs and are now the manufacturer of the instruments. The WQM instruments are calibrated and swapped out on a regular basis. Salinity is stored as a double with the units of PSU. 2.3.2 Data extraction Data is directly inserted into a database from the real time system over the cellular network. The general public can use this link to explore and pull that data from the CBIBS database. The process for data extraction for this indicator can be found here. 2.3.3 Data analysis The data is processed by a python script. This creates an array and runs the data through a qartod routine. The result is a set of flags. Only the good data is used in the plot below. 2.3.4 Data processing Code for processing salinity data can be found here.

These heatwaves are measured in terms of magnitude and duration by using satellite measurements of daily sea surface temperature. Here we use the marine heatwave metrics defined by Hobday et al. 2016 such that a warm event in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank is considered a marine heatwave if the event lasts for five or more days with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a historical climatology (1982-2010). In 2019, the Gulf of Maine experienced four distinct marine heatwaves in the summer and fall with the strongest event beginning on July 3 and lasting 53 days (GOM_2019_Heatwave_time_series.pdf dark red = strongest event of the year, light red = weaker events). Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 12th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+3.27 oC above average on Aug 1) and 12th on record in terms of cumulative intensity (112 oC-days [sum of daily intensity anomalies]) (GOM_1982_2019_Heatwave_Max_Intensity_time_series.pdf and GOM_1982_2019_Heatwave_Cumul_Intensity_time_series.pdf). The strongest heatwaves on record in the Gulf of Maine occurred in the summer of 2010 in terms of maximum intensity (+4.83 oC above average) and in the summer of 2012 in terms of cumulative intensity (630 oC-days). The impacts of the 2012 marine heatwave in the Gulf of Maine have been well documented within the lobster fishery (Mills et al. 2013). In 2019, Georges Bank experienced three distinct marine heatwaves in the summer and fall with the strongest event beginning on August 17 and lasting 20 days (GB_2019_Heatwave_time_series.pdf dark red = strongest event of the year, light red = weaker events). Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 15th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+3.14 oC above average on Aug 23) (GB_1982_2019_Heatwave_Max_Intensity_time_series.pdf). The strongest heatwaves on record in the Georges Bank occurred in the summer of 2016 in terms of maximum intensity (+4.06 oC above average) and in the winter/spring/summer of 2012 in terms of cumulative intensity (485 oC-days). 3.1.2 Marine Heatwaves (2019 MAB) Marine heatwaves can derive from both atmospheric and oceanographic factors that can have dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems. These heatwaves are measured in terms of magnitude and duration by using satellite measurements of daily sea surface temperature. Here we use the marine heatwave metrics defined by Hobday et al. 2016 such that a warm event in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank is considered a marine heatwave if the event lasts for five or more days with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a historical climatology (1982-2010). In 2019, the Middle Atlantic Bight experienced six distinct marine heatwaves in the spring, summer, and fall with one of the strongest events beginning on July 3 and lasting 21 days (MAB_2019_Heatwave_time_series.pdf dark red = strongest event of the year, light red = weaker events). Relative to prior years, this marine heatwave ranked 17th on record in terms of maximum intensity (+2.88 oC above average on Jul 22) (MAB_1982_2019_Heatwave_Max_Intensity_time_series.pdf). Another strong marine heatwave began on Aug 1 and lasted 24 days, which was 20th on record in terms of cumulative intensity (46 oC-days [sum of daily intensity anomalies]) (MAB_1982_2019_Heatwave_Cumul_Intensity_time_series.pdf). The strongest heatwaves on record in the Middle Atlantic Bight occurred in the winter of 2012 in terms of maximum intensity (+5.13 oC above average) and in the winter/summer of 2012 in terms of cumulative intensity (515 oC-days). 3.1.3 Plotting Code used for the plots below can be found here.

(2016). 3.2.1 Data sources NOAA high-res OISST (daily, 25-km, 1982-2019) https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/db_search/DBListFiles.pl?did=132&amp;tid=79458&amp;vid=2423 3.2.2 Data extraction Each yearly file (global) was downloaded, concatenated into a single netcdf file using nco (Unix), and then cropped to the USNES region using Ferret. Each EPU’s time-series of SST was averaged using .shp file boundaries for the MAB, GB, and GOM (also done in Ferret) and saved to the three .csv files. 3.2.3 Data analysis The marine heatwave metrics Maximum Intensity [deg. C] and Cumulative Intensity [deg. C x days] are calculated using NOAA OISST daily sea surface temperature data (25-km resolution) from January 1982 to December 2019. The heatwaves are calculated based on the algorithms in Hobday et al. 2016 and by using a climatology of 1982-2010. These metrics were run R using https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/ 3.2.4 Data processing Marine Heatwave data were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using this R code.

Contributor(s): Michael Fogarty, Andrew Beet Data steward: Andrew Beet, andrew.beet@noaa.gov Point of contact: Andrew Beet, andrew.beet@noaa.gov 4.1 Impact Summary The amount of total fish yield we can expect from a marine ecosystem depends on the amount of production entering at the base of the food web, primarily in the form of phytoplankton; the pathways this energy follows to reach harvested species; the efficiency of transfer of energy at each step in the food web; and the fraction of this production that is removed by the fisheries. Species such as scallops and clams primarily feed directly on larger phytoplankton species and therefore require only one step in the transfer of energy. The loss of energy at each step can exceed 80-90%. For many fish species, as many as 2-4 steps may be necessary. Given the trophic level and the efficiency of energy transfer of the species in the ecosystem, the proportion of phytoplankton production required (PPR) to account for the observed catch can be estimated. 4.1.1 Plotting Four plots are produced for each EPU: The normalized PPR index (along with the associated landings).

Included are the top species accounting for 80% of the landings in each year. 4.1.2 Raw Data The raw data is available in the ecodata package. 4.2 Methods The index is a measure of the impact of fishing on the base of the foodweb. The amount of potential yield we can expect from a marine ecosystem depends on the amount of production entering at the base of the food web, primarily in the form of phytoplankton; the pathways this energy follows to reach harvested species; the efficiency of transfer of energy at each step in the food web; and the fraction of this production that is removed by the fisheries. Species such as scallops and clams primarily feed directly on larger phytoplankton species and therefore require only one step in the transfer of energy. The loss of energy at each step can exceed 80-90%. For many fish species, as many as 2-4 steps may be necessary. Given the trophic level and the efficiency of energy transfer of the species in the ecosystem the amount phytoplankton production required (PPR) to account for the observed catch can be estimated. The index for Primary Production Required (PPR) was adapted from (Pauly and Christensen 1995). \\[PPR_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_t} \\left(\\frac{landings_{t,i}}{9}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{TE}\\right)^{TL_i-1}\\] where \\(n_t\\) = number of species in time \\(t\\), \\(landings_{t,i}\\) = landings of species \\(i\\) in time \\(t\\), \\(TL_i\\) is the trophic level of species \\(i\\), \\(TE\\) = Trophic efficiency. The PPR estimate assumes a 9:1 ratio for the conversion of wet weight to carbon and a 15% transfer efficiency per trophic level, (\\(TE\\) = 0.15) The index is presented as a percentage of estimated primary production (PP) available over the geographic region of interest, termed an Ecological Production Unit (EPU). The scaled index is estimated by dividing the PPR index in year \\(t\\) by the estimated primary production in time \\(t\\). \\[scaledPPR_t = \\frac{PPR_t}{PP_t}\\] The species selected in each year were determined by their cumulative contribution to total landings. A threshold of at least 80% of the total landings is used. 4.2.1 Data sources Data for this index come from a variety of sources. The landings data come from the Commercial Fishery Database (CFDBS), species trophic level information come from fishbase and sealifebase, and primary production estimates are derived from satellites. Some of these data are typically not available to the public. 4.2.2 Data extraction Landings are extracted from the commercial fisheries database (CFDBS) using the methods described in the chapter Commercial Landings Data. Trophic level information for each species is obtained from fishbase and sealifebase using the R package rfishbase (Froese and Pauly 2019) in tandem with the package indexPPR. Primary Production is estimated using the methods described in the chapter Chlorophyll a and Primary Production. 4.2.3 Data analysis Annual (wet weight) landings are calculated for each species for a given EPU. For each year the landings are sorted in descending order by species and the cumulative landings are calculated. The top species that accounted for 80% of total cumulative landings are selected. The trophic level for each of these species are then obtained from fishbase/sealifebase. At this point the PPR index is calculated. The units of the index are \\(gCyear^{-1}\\) for the EPU. The index is converted to \\(gCm^{-2}year^{-1}\\) by dividing by the area (in \\(m^2\\)) of the EPU. To normalize the index the total Primiary Production for the given EPU is required. This is calculated as described in the chapter Chlorophyll a and Primary Production. The units are also converted to \\(gCm^{-2}year^{-1}\\). The index is then normalized by dividing the index in year t by the total primary production in time \\(t\\).

Stomach fullness may be a better measure than absolute stomach weight if combining across species into a feeding guild, to prevent larger animals with heavier stomachs from dominating the index. An average stomach fullness was calcuated annually for each species and Ecological Production Unit (EPU). 5.2.1 Data Sources Stomach contents weights and individual fish weights (both to the nearest gram) were collected on the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys from 1992-present aboard RVs Albatross IV, Delaware II and the Henry B.
