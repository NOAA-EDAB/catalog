<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.2.3</span> Data analysis</h3>
<p>We defined size thresholds separating small and large fish for each species based on the 20th percentile of the length distribution across all years. This threshold was then used to calculate a small and large fish index (numbers below and above the threshold, respectively) each year. Although the length percentile corresponding to age-1 fish will vary with species, we use the 20th percentile as an approximation. Biomass was calculated using length–weight relationships directly from the survey data. Following <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="wigley_length-weight_2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, the length-weight relationship was modeled as
<span class="math display">\[\ln W = \ln a + b \ln L\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is weight (kg), <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is length (cm), and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are parameters fit via linear regression. The ratio of small fish numbers of the following year to larger fish biomass in the current year was used as the index of recruitment success. The fall and spring recruitment success anomalies were averaged to provide an annual index of recruitment success.</p>
